Vulkan initialization:
- Implemented staging buffer (https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Vertex_buffers/Staging_buffer).
	- Function modified: createVertexBuffer, copyBuffer created to copy the contents, abstract buffer creation in createBuffer.
- Implemented multisampling anti-aliasing (https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Multisampling).
	- Function modified: createColorResources, createImage(modifies samples), add colorAttachmentResolve in renderPass creation, add msaaSamples in createGraphicsPipeline.
- Implemented resize of the window (https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Drawing_a_triangle/Swap_chain_recreation).
	- Function modified: divide the cleanup into two functions -> one to cleanup the SwapChain and the other one when the program is closing, add a function to recreate the SwapChain.
- Optimize the vertex and indices loading for a model.
- Implemented choose of depth format (https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Depth_buffering).
