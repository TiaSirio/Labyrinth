If you have downloaded the package in ZIP format (without VOLK enabled),
navigate to the manual_install folder and run the program according to your operating system (Windows/Linux/Mac).
The program will install the Vulkan SDK.
Once the installation is complete, you can run the application located in the "bin/" folder.
